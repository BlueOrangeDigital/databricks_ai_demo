Classical AI
Regressors and Classifiers serve as the foundational building blocks of classical artificial intelligence (AI), underpinning many of its core principles and methodologies. In classical AI, classifiers are instrumental in solving problems related to pattern recognition, decision making, and categorization. By leveraging algorithms such as decision trees, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, classifiers can effectively distinguish between different classes or categories in datasets, enabling tasks like document classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis. Similarly, regressions play a pivotal role in classical AI by modeling the relationships between input variables and continuous output values. Techniques like linear regression, polynomial regression, and neural networks are employed to predict outcomes such as sales forecasts, stock prices, and population trends. Together, classifiers and regressions provide a robust framework for addressing a wide range of AI challenges, forming the bedrock upon which many AI applications and systems are built.
Regressor
In the insurance industry, predicting premiums accurately is essential for ensuring fair pricing and risk management. Imagine a scenario where an insurance company seeks to determine the appropriate premium for car insurance policies. This regression problem involves predicting the premium based on several key factors: gender, insured value, year of the product (manufacture year), and number of seats in the insured vehicle. Gender might influence premium rates due to statistical differences in driving behavior or accident risk between genders. Insured value reflects the monetary worth of the vehicle, which can directly impact the potential cost of claims. Year of the product indicates the age of the vehicle, with older vehicles potentially facing higher premiums due to increased risk of mechanical failure or depreciation. Additionally, the number of seats in the vehicle could correlate with the likelihood of carrying passengers and thus affect the risk profile. By leveraging machine learning techniques like linear regression, insurers can analyze historical data to build predictive models that estimate premiums based on these variables, ultimately enabling more accurate pricing and informed decision-making.
In the context of Spark MLlib, vector columns are essential for operating on datasets because most machine learning algorithms expect input data to be in vector format. By organizing features into a vector column, it allows algorithms to efficiently process and analyze the data. VectorAssembler is a transformer in Spark MLlib that concatenates multiple feature columns into a single vector column, which is necessary for training machine learning models. This transformation is crucial for preparing data before feeding it into machine learning algorithms, enabling seamless integration with various MLlib functionalities.
The code below demonstrates how to use Spark MLlib to perform linear regression on a dataset named "motor_insurance." First, the necessary modules are imported, including LinearRegression for building the regression model and VectorAssembler for creating a vector column. The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame called dfs using Spark's SQL API. Then, VectorAssembler is utilized to assemble the features specified in the inputCols parameter ('GENDER', 'INSURED_VALUE', 'PROD_YEAR', 'SEATS_NUM') into a single vector column named 'FEAT_VECT'. This transformed DataFrame, dfv, is then used to train a LinearRegression model (linreg), where the 'FEAT_VECT' column serves as the features and the 'PREMIUM' column is designated as the label. Once the model is trained, the coefficients and intercept of the linear regression model are printed. This code showcases a typical workflow in Spark MLlib for preparing data and training machine learning models for regression tasks.
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression 
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler 
dfs = spark.table("motors_insurance") 
dfv = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['GENDER','INSURED_VALUE','PROD_YEAR','SEATS_NUM'],outputCol='FEAT_VECT').transform(dfs) 
dfv.select('FEAT_VECT').show(5)

Next, we want to infer premium prices for car insurance policies based on specified attributes. First, a DataFrame named fut is created using Spark's createDataFrame method, containing two rows of data representing hypothetical insurance policies. Each row consists of four features: GENDER (0 for male, 1 for female), INSURED_VALUE (the insured value of the vehicle, in this case, 33,000 USD), PROD_YEAR (the year of production or manufacture of the vehicle, here set to 2024), and SEATS_NUM (the number of seats in the vehicle, set to 5). Next, VectorAssembler is applied to fut, combining the specified input columns into a single feature vector column named 'FEAT_VECT' in the DataFrame futv. Then, the trained linear regression model linreg is used to make predictions on the features in futv, resulting in a DataFrame named preds containing the original features along with predicted premium prices. Finally, the predictions are displayed using the show method, showing the inferred premium prices for both male and female policyholders for the hypothetical car insurance policies.
fut = spark.createDataFrame([(0,33000,2024,5),
                             (1,33000,2024,5)],
                            ['GENDER','INSURED_VALUE','PROD_YEAR','SEATS_NUM'])
futv = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['GENDER','INSURED_VALUE','PROD_YEAR','SEATS_NUM'], outputCol='FEAT_VECT').transform(fut)
preds = linreg.transform(futv)
preds.select('prediction').show()

Classifier
In Spark, one of the most important classifiers is Random Forest Classifier. It is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. For the example here, we are going to use financial risk assessment for loan approvals dataset.
The code below then employs VectorAssembler to merge the relevant attributes (age, income, loan amount, credit score, months employed, number of credit lines, interest rate, loan term, mortgage status, and dependents) into a single feature vector column named 'features'. After assembling the features using VectorAssembler, a RandomForestClassifier is trained using the transformed DataFrame dfv, where the 'features' column serves as the input features, and the 'Default' column indicates whether a loan is in default or not.Â 
To illustrate the predictive capability of the trained model, the code then creates a Spark DataFrame called fut, representing a hypothetical loan applicant aged 33, with an income of $88,000, a credit score of 700, seeking a $33,000 loan for 36 months at a 6.5% interest rate. The applicant has a mortgage and dependents.
from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
dfs = spark.table("Loans_default")  
vector_assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['Age', 'Income', 'LoanAmount', 'CreditScore', 'MonthsEmployed', 'NumCreditLines',
                   'InterestRate', 'LoanTerm', 'HasMortgage', 'HasDependents'], outputCol="features")
dfv = vector_assembler.transform(dfs)
dfv.select('features').show(5)
+--------------------+

|[32.0,31713.0,447...|
|[60.0,20437.0,913...|
|[36.0,42053.0,923...|
|[28.0,140466.0,16...|
+--------------------+

classif = RandomForestClassifier(featuresCol="features", labelCol='Default').fit(dfv)
fut = spark.createDataFrame([(33, 88000, 33000, 700, 60, 1, 0.065, 36, 1, 1)], 
                            ['Age', 'Income', 'LoanAmount', 'CreditScore', 'MonthsEmployed', 'NumCreditLines',
                             'InterestRate', 'LoanTerm', 'HasMortgage', 'HasDependents'])
futv = vector_assembler.transform(fut) 
predictions = classif.transform(futv)
predictions.select("prediction").show()
On the example, the prediction for the fictional individual is not expected to get defaulted.
